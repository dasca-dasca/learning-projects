• A standard 52-card deck is used, and cards are shuffled before each round.  
• The game follows classic Blackjack rules: face cards are worth 10 points, numbered cards are worth their face value, and Aces can be worth 1 or 11 points.  
• The goal is to get a hand value closer to 21 than the dealer without going over.
